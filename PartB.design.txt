The monitor will use a client-Server IPC setup. Client threads message 
a server thread (via the standard Monitor procedures) with requests 
such as enter, leave, signal, wait. Clients block during Send calls to
the server thread, the server thread determines what must be done, and 
eventually unblocks the client thread with a reply. 

For example, MonEnter() will send a REQUEST_ENTER message to the server 
thread. The server thread processes the message, and places the client 
in a wait queue, only replying to the client thread when its time for 
the client thread to enter the monitor.
