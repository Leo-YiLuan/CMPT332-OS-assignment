The bash script is designed to handle both automated input, and 
interactive input. It tests to ensure the right program is being run 
on the correct platform. If this passes, it runs in a loop, accepting 
lines of input from either stdin or a file, depending on whether its 
running interactively. Each line is then split into tokens which are 
tested for correctness of input (whether they are nonzero). The script 
then executes the correct binary and continues the loop, until it 
either receives a quit command (in interactive mode) or it reaches 
the EOF.
