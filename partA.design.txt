The main function parses the arguments passed in through argv via a seperate
function parse_args. This is done because args between the different executables
will not change, so we can reuse this function in every executable for 
Part A.

CreateThread is called, passing the fibonacci size parameter into a function
where the child thread will live for the duration of its lifetime. The
signature is unsigned int (*)(void*) as is required by the CreateThread 
api call. main will need to use GetLastError() in the future in order
to perform api error checking. 

fib(), as specified in the assignment documentation, is also moved to a seperate
c file in order to facilitate code reuse. It is a simple recursive function that
accepts as a parameter the nth fibonacci number to calculate, where n >= 0.

Considerations: It may be a good idea to wrap our isRunning global variable in
a Win32 mutex.
