A few things that we should include in our test results 
to demonstrate correctness:

1. Test executing a command in the local dir, with "./"
2. Test executing a command in the local dir, without 
"./. Should fail as dot is not in the hardcoded path 
array. 
3. Test executing a command with parameters, to test 
correct tokenization.
4. Test commands of different lengths, to test 
correct fetching of the line. 
5. Test executing a command found within the hardcoded 
path array. 
6. Test cd both with and without absolute paths.
7. Test cd with a nonexistent path. 
8. Test pipes, both 1 and many pipe tokens. 
9. Test exit.
