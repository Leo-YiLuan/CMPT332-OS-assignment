White box testing ideas:

1. Need to test messages of different lengths, to ensure that there's no
memory errors involved in the mallocing in the keyboard thread.
2. Need to test communicating on different architectures to ensure no 
platform specific issues. 
3. Need to test with the machines using two different ports. 
4. Need to test rapid message transfers to ensure list buffer is working 
and timestamps are working.
