CreateList():
    * Test under circumstances
    * Test after exceeding the maximum number of active lists,
      check for NULL pointer return.

ListCount():
    * When list is empty.
    * When list contains one element.
    * When list contains many elements.
    * After an element has been added.
    * After an element has been removed.

ListFirst():
    * When list is empty. Should return NULL?
    * When there's only one element.
    * When there's many elements.

ListLast():
    * When list is empty. Should return NULL?
    * When there's only one element.
    * When there's many elements.

ListNext():
    * When the list is empty. Return NULL.
    * When there is only one element in list. Return NULL, can't continue.
    * When there are many elements in the list.
    * When currNode is at the last element.

ListPrev():
    * When the list is empty. Return NULL.
    * When there is only one element in the list. Return NULL, can't go prev.
    * When there are many elements in the list
    * When currNode is at the first element.

ListCurr():
    * When the list is empty. Return NULL.
    * When currNode is first.
    * When currNode is last.
    * When currNode is somewhere in the middle.

 ListAdd():
    * When the list is empty.
    * When there is one element in the list.
    * When there are multiple elements in the list.
    * When there are multiple elements, and we are at end.
    * When there are no more nodes left.

ListInsert():
    * When the list is empty.
    * When there is one element.
    * When there are many elements in the list.
    * When there are many elements, and we are at begin.
    * When there are no more nodes left.

ListAppend():
    * When the list is empty.
    * When there is one element.
    * When there are many elements, and we are already at the end.
    * When there are many elements, and we are not at the end.
    * when there are no more nodes left.

ListPrepend():
    * When the list is empty.
    * When there is one element.
    * When there are many elements, and we are already at begin.
    * When there are many elements, and we are not at begin.

ListRemove():
    * When the list is empty. Return NULL?
    * When there is one element.
    * When there are many elements.
    * When there are many elements, beginning of list. (Test Correct Begin)
    * When there are many elements, end of the list (Test Correct End)

ListConcat():

    * Two empty lists.
    * One empty list, one non-empty.
    * Two non-empty lists.

ListFree():
    * Freeing an empty list.
    * Freeing a list with one element.
    * Freeing a list with many elements.

ListTrim():
    * When list is empty. Return NULL?
    * When list has 1 element. currNode would get set to NULL?
    * When list has many elements, not at end.
    * When list has many elements, and at end.
